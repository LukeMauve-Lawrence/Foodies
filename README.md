# Foodies
This is my first Android Studio application. <br />
Android Application for tracking calorie consumption. <br />
Allows for user input to capture calories consumed and weight and posts it to the database. <br />
Data can be set to either be Metric or Imperial for the user's preference <br />
The database used for this application is Firebase Realtime Database. <br />
Displays users consumed calories for the day in the form of a Pie Chart <br />
and displays weight changes for the last week in the form of a Bar Chart. <br />
